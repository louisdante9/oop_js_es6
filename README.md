# oop_js_es6
This is an OOP implementation of modelling a real-world scenario/problem, 
while taking advantage of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and the other OOP concepts
Test implementation of a 'class' in javascript. Behaviours I wanted this implementation to exhibit:

* Instantiation:
    * Create new instances of the class, preferably with the new keyword.
* Inheritance
    * A subclass that extends a class should inherit all public methods and properties from that class. It should also be possible to call the parent's method if overriding a method.
* Encapsulation
    * A class should have private variables and these should not be static, in other words, they should not be shared across all instances of a subclass.
    * There should be no direct read or write access to a private variable from outside the instance of a class. However, it should be possible to read and write the private variable through both private and public methods within the instance.
